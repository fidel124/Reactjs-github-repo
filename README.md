A React App that searches for GitHub repository, using the repository name.

-- Before you try this app, you will first of all install all the dependencies in the "package.json" file.
    npm install <then press enter key>

-- To start the app you will have to type in the commandline.
    npm start <then press enyter key>

-- Now see your browser in the http://localhost:3000



I used the github api to get repository names from github based on the name entered by the user.

I used gulp to minify the css

More and more things can still be done!
